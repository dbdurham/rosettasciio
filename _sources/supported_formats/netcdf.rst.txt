.. _netcdf-format:

NetCDF (EELSlab) format
-----------------------

The ``.nc`` format was the default format in HyperSpy's predecessor, EELSLab, but it has been
superseded by :ref:`hspy-format` in RosettaSciIO. We provide only reading capabilities
but we do not support writing to this format.

Note that only NetCDF files written by EELSLab are supported.

To use this format a python netcdf interface must be installed manually because
it is not installed by default when using the automatic installers.
