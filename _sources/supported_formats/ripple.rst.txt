Ripple format
-------------

The ``.rpl`` format (short for "Raw Parameter List") is an *open standard format*
developed at NIST as native format for `Lispix
<https://www.nist.gov/services-resources/software/lispix>`_ and is widely used to
exchange multidimensional data. However, it only supports data of up to three
dimensions.

The ``.rpl`` file lists the characteristics of the corresponding ``.raw`` file so
that it can be loaded without human intervention. Thus, the reader parses a
``.rpl`` file and reads the data from the corresponding
``.raw`` file, or directly from a ``.raw`` file if the dictionary ``rpl_info`` is
provided.

It can also be used to exchange data with Bruker and used in
combination with the :ref:`import-rpl` it is very useful for exporting data
to Gatan's Digital Micrograph.

The default encoding is latin-1. It is possible to set a different encoding
using the encoding argument, e.g. when using HyperSpy to save a file:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> s.save('file.rpl', encoding = 'utf8')

For ``.rpl`` files, ``hs.load`` takes the ``mmap_mode`` keyword argument enabling
loading the file using a different mode (default is copy-on-write). However,
note that lazy loading does not support in-place writing (i.e lazy loading and
the "r+" mode are incompatible).

.. note::

    This format may not provide information on the calibration.
    If so, you should add that after loading the file.


Format description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Images and spectral images or data cubes that are written in the
(Lispix) raw file format are just a continuous string of numbers.

Data cubes can be stored image by image, or spectrum by spectrum.
Single images are stored row by row, vector cubes are stored row by row
(each row spectrum by spectrum), image cubes are stored image by image.

All of the numbers are in the same format, such as 16 bit signed integer,
IEEE 8-byte real, 8-bit unsigned byte, etc.

The ``.raw`` file should be accompanied by an ASCII text, tab delimited file with the
same name and ``.rpl`` extension. This "raw parameter list" file lists the
characteristics of the ``.raw`` file.

Some of the following keys are specific to HyperSpy and will be ignored by other software.

Notes
,,,,, 

When ``'data-length'`` is 1, the ``'byte order'`` is not relevant as there is only
one byte per datum, and ``'byte-order'`` should be ``'dont-care'``.

When ``'depth'`` is 1, the file has one image, ``'record-by'`` is not relevant and
should be ``'dont-care'``. For spectral images, ``'record-by'`` is 'vector'.
For stacks of images, ``'record-by'`` is ``'image'``.

Floating point numbers can be IEEE 4-byte, or IEEE 8-byte. Therefore if
data-type is float, data-length MUST be 4 or 8.

The ``.rpl`` file is read in a case-insensitive manner. However, when providing
a dictionary as input, the keys MUST be lowercase.

Comment lines, beginning with a semi-colon ``;`` are allowed anywhere.

The first non-comment in the ``.rpl`` file line MUST have two column names:
``'name_1'<TAB>'name_2'``; any name would do e.g. ``'key'<TAB>'value'``.

Parameters can be in ANY order.

In the ``.rpl`` file, the parameter name is followed by ONE tab (spaces are
ignored) e.g.: ``'data-length'<TAB>'2'``

In the ``.rpl`` file, other data and more tabs can follow the two items on
each row, and are ignored.

Other keys and values can be included and are ignored.

Any number of spaces can go along with each tab.
